# File Description
* The ` file primarily` preprocesses the raw data, extracting data from the 'X2' and '25' channels to generate a complete ECG dataset. rec_data is a single-channel ECG file extracted from the .rec file, and label is a label file generated by expert 1's scoring.
* In data_reading, `extraction_chanel.py` extracts the original .rec file to generate single-channel ECG data, and `label_creat.py` processes the label sequence. Through data_reading, we obtain raw data that can be used by the model.
* The loaddata file is the data loading component, used to match the ECG data in each rec_data folder with the labeled data in the label folder. It also performs filtering and data conversion for subsequent model input. Running loaddata yields the dual-channel image and labeled data (merged_sleep_data_combined.npz).
* The model file is the model component, which includes three model classes: **CnnGruModel** for untransformed raw time series ECG data, **CnnImageModel** for image data without channel fusion, and **CnnImageModelC2** for image data with channel fusion.
* The main file is the five-fold cross-training and evaluation component of the model.
* The runs folder contains the confusion matrix and corresponding weight files for each fold, and the fold folder contains the binary TensorBoard log for each fold.
* The filter visualization folder contains the two-channel image visualization files (first_data_image_channel_0.png and first_data_image_channel_1.png).
* merged_sleep_data_combined.npz is the model input data corresponding to the channel data and labels obtained after the loaddata process. * For details about third-party libraries, see **requirements.txt**
